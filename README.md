This project aims to implement a gaming console to encourage the elderly and patients with Ortega disease to get into the habit of exercising regularly. In this report, we will collect data using Vicon, which is a motion capture system and fine-tune an existing model- MoveNet which is pose estimation model. The gaming console adopts MoveNet for real-time motion tracking and interacts with users after the analyzed result from pose. 

Next semester, we will implement more accurate control methods to recognize pose and finish the data collection to fine tune the model. Also exploring several machine learning and deep learning algorithms for reliably classifying exercise positions in both prepared and real-time films.
